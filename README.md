# OSF Addon Service (GravyValet)

Welcome to the Open Science Framework's base server for addon integration with our RESTful API (osf.io). This server acts as a gateway between the OSF and external APIs. Authenticated users or machines can access various resources through common file storage and citation management APIs via the OSF. Institutional members can also add their own integrations, tailoring addon usage to their specific communities.

## Setting up GravyValet Locally

1. Start your PostgreSQL and Django containers with `docker compose up -d`.
2. Enter the Django container: `docker compose exec addon_service /bin/bash`.
3. Migrate the existing models: `python3 manage.py migrate`.
4. Visit [http://0.0.0.0:8004/](http://0.0.0.0:8004/).

## Running Tests

To run tests, use the following command:

```bash
python3 manage.py test
```

Development Tips

Optionally, but recommended: Set up pre-commit hooks that will run formatters and linters on staged files. Install pre-commit using:

```bash

pip install pre-commit
```

Then, run:

```bash

pre-commit install --allow-missing-config
```
